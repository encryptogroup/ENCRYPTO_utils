 \brief		 libdgk - v0.9
 A library implementing the DGK crypto system with full decryption
 Thanks to Marina Blanton for sharing her Miracl DGK implementation from
 M. Blanton and P. Gasti, "Secure and efficient protocols for iris and fingerprint identification" (ESORICSâ€™11)
 with us. We used it as a template for this GMP version.

 The implementation structure was inspired by
 libpailler - A library implementing the Paillier crypto system. (http://hms.isi.jhu.edu/acsc/libpaillier/)
